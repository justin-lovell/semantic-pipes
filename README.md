semantic-pipes
==============

Inspired by UNIX pipes. Push current object (context) into a pipeline which will semantically resolve to the object type which you need.


Note
----
Currently, I am still putting everything together so not ready for anything useful to be done.

I'm developing this out in the open so that I can force myself to work on this everyday; an effort to do open source development more often.
